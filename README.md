# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

🧠 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project – where machine learning meets medical insight! 💉📊
This project leverages powerful ML algorithms to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health parameters. It demonstrates the potential of data science in making life-saving predictions and guiding preventive healthcare decisions. 💡

📌 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict diabetes using patient medical data from the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. This can assist in early diagnosis and intervention, which are crucial for managing chronic diseases like diabetes.

🎯 Key Objectives
🧹 Clean and preprocess the dataset

🔍 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand variable impact

🧠 Train and test various ML models

🧪 Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

📉 Compare models and identify the best-performing one

📊 Visualize results with plots and performance metrics

🔍 Key Insights
High glucose levels and BMI are strong indicators of diabetes

Age and number of pregnancies also contribute to higher risk

Among tested models, Random Forest and SVM performed the best (Accuracy ~80%)

Balanced datasets and proper scaling improved performance significantly
