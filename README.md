# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction Project** – where **machine learning meets medical insight**!  
This project leverages powerful ML algorithms to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various health parameters.  
It showcases how **data science can empower preventive healthcare** and drive early intervention. 💉📊

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can **accurately predict diabetes** using patient medical data from the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

🔬 This project can help:
- Support early diagnosis of diabetes
- Guide preventive healthcare decisions
- Highlight the importance of health data in chronic disease management

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- 🧹 Clean and preprocess the dataset
- 🔍 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- 🧠 Train and evaluate multiple ML models
- 🧪 Measure performance using various evaluation metrics
- 📊 Visualize and interpret results
- 🏆 Identify the best-performing model
